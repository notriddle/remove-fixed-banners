Removing auto-scrolling banners
===============================

A set of [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) filters to conserve vertical screen real estate.
This filter removes nag boxes, persistent bars, and comments sections with poor moderation.

### Installation

To add these filters to your own list, go to the uBlock Origin Settings page,
then go to Custom, then check the Import box.
